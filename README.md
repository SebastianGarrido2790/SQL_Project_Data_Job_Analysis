## ❓ Key Questions

This project answers the following data-driven questions using SQL:

1. **What are the top-paying data scientist jobs?**
2. **What skills are required for these high-paying roles?**
3. **What are the most in-demand skills across the job market?**
4. **Which skills are associated with higher average salaries?**
5. **Which skills are both in high demand and high paying (optimal to learn)?**
6. **(Bonus)** Additional insights:
   - Company-wise salary trends
   - Common job title patterns
   - Degree requirements
   - Remote vs. onsite job locations
   - Health insurance availability
   - Skills combinations in single job roles
