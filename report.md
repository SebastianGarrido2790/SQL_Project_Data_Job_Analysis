# 🔍 The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Each subsection includes strategic insights to guide job seekers, educators, or hiring teams.

## 1.  💰 Top-Paying Data Science Jobs

The dataset contains 1,086 job postings for data scientist roles, with the following relevant columns:

* `job_id`: Unique identifier for each job post
* `job_title`: Title of the data science role
* `salary_year_avg`: Average yearly salary for the role
* `company_name`: Hiring company
* `skills`: A single skill associated with the role (note: only one skill per row)

The `skills` column contains one skill per row, so the same job may appear in multiple rows with different skills. I will now analyze the `skills` column to provide insights such as:

* Most frequently requested skills
* Average salary per skill
* Skill co-occurrence (if meaningful despite one-skill-per-row)
