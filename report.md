# üîç The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data scientist job market. Each subsection includes strategic insights to guide job seekers, educators, or hiring teams.

## 1.  üí∞ Top-Paying Data Science Jobs

The dataset contains 1,086 job postings for data scientist roles, with the following relevant columns:

* `job_id`: Unique identifier for each job post
* `job_title`: Title of the data science role
* `salary_year_avg`: Average yearly salary for the role
* `company_name`: Hiring company
* `skills`: A single skill associated with the role (note: only one skill per row)

The `skills` column contains one skill per row, so the same job may appear in multiple rows with different skills. I will now analyze the `skills` column to provide insights such as:

* Most frequently requested skills
* Average salary per skill
* Skill co-occurrence (if meaningful despite one-skill-per-row)

## 2. ‚è∞ **Job Schedule Type vs. Salary**

| Schedule Type                        | Avg Salary (USD) | Count |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----- |
| Full-time                            | \$146,019        | 902   |
| Full-time + Part-time                | \$144,850        | 6     |
| Part-time                            | \$135,000        | 2     |
| Contractor                           | \$112,742        | 33    |
| Internship                           | \$101,840        | 1     |
| Full-time, Part-time, and Internship | \$43,030         | 1     |

### üí° Insights:

* **Full-time roles** dominate both in volume and salary, reaffirming their status as the most stable and lucrative path.
* **Contractor positions** offer significantly lower pay on average, possibly due to fewer benefits and less job security.
* **Hybrid schedules** (Full-time + other types) don‚Äôt consistently offer higher pay, suggesting salary isn't directly tied to flexibility.

**Implication**: For maximizing income, pursuing full-time roles remains the most effective strategy. Contractor roles may suit those seeking flexibility, but likely at a financial trade-off.
